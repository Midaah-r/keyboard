# keyboard 

### 27th July (day 1): reasearch and brainstorming

ðŸ˜­i was busy with exams and kept this project on a hold. This is my first time doing a project of this complexity and i didnt know anyhting about the workings of a mechanical keyboard and i have never owned one but.

I spent the ENTIRE (around 4 hours) day researching keyboard jargon, engineering, stabilizers, switches, parts, layouts etc... I found a few keebs for inspo

That sums up my day along with simultaneously working on my macropad (slickopad :) ) which also helped my understand the working and workflow better.
